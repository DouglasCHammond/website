I'm an assistant professor at Bob Jones University teaching Computer Science and a Software Engineer for AFS Logistics, LLC.  I teach courses covering computer science fundamentals, computer systems, software development / engineering and computer science theory.  At work, I build high-throughput backends for scalable web-applications.  I've also built a couple of robots.

When I'm not in the classroom or the office, I enjoy cross-country running, hiking and cycling. I also enjoy traveling and have been to a couple of different places throughout North America.

Here is a current copy of my [resume](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bulletshot60-website/pdf/current-resume.pdf) and my [CV](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bulletshot60-website/pdf/current-cv.pdf) if you're interested in those sorts of things.
