I'm a third year PhD student at Clemson University studying Dynamic Software Product Lines and a professor of Computer Science at Bob Jones University. My interests include safety-critical software, dynamic software, compiler architecture and software ecosystems. I love designing web applications, and I've made a couple of robots.

When I'm not in the classroom or lab, I enjoy cross-country running, hiking and cycling. I also enjoy traveling and have been to a couple of different places throughout North America.

Here is a current copy of my [resume](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bulletshot60-website/pdf/current-resume.pdf) and my [CV](https://s3.amazonaws.com/bulletshot60-website/pdf/current-cv.pdf) if you're interested in those sorts of things.
