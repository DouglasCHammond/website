# Lab 3

## Overview

For this lab you will write C code to solve several bit-manipulation puzzles from your textbook.  Namely:

* 2.64: `any_odd_one`
* 2.66: `leftmost_one`
* 2.68: `lower_one_mask`

## Procedure

Use the [starting code](/bju/cps230/homework/lab3-downloads/lab3.c).  Your job is to

* Fill out the function bodies (i.e., replace the `/* TODO */` comments)
* Add a few more tests for each function implemented (see the existing comments in the code for more)

**Be sure to follow the rules specified on p. 120!**  Among other things, these rules *prohibit loops* (since you don't need them).

## Hints

* 2.66 is the hardest of the 3; save it for last

## Report

Follow the [standard template](/bju/cps230/downloads/lab_report_template.docx), and make sure you explain how you solved each puzzle (i.e., your thought process, not your code).

## Submission

Submit `report.docx/pdf` and your completed `lab3.c`.

## Grading

This lab is worth **15 points** total:

* 9 points for a well-formed submission (including report)
* 2 points for each problem solved
