# Data Types / Variables

To the processor, every piece of information is numeric.  Video, word documents, games, pictures, etc. are all represented using numbers at a fundamental level.  It should come as no surprise that Python therefore has great support for mathematical operations.  But first, how in the world do you print stuff (or show it to the user)?

## Printing

Printing or displaying information is one of the most basic problems in Computer Science, right along with getting input from the user.  The most famous comptuer program is the `Hello World` program which is used to demonstrate how to produce output in a given programming language.

Here is `Hello World` in Python:
```py
print("Hello World")
```

We'll see more examples of using print as we go... (as well as how to do input).

## Mathematical Operations

Python supports many of the common (as well as uncommon) mathematical operators.
