# Biblical Philosophy of Technology Paper

> There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.”
> Proverbs 19:21

## Overview

As Christians we cannot compartmentalize our lives. Knowing Christ affects every area of our lives, including the way we use technology. Very few areas of our lives are unaffected by the technology that surrounds us. When we talk about technology for the purpose of this paper, we are not limited in scope
to computers. Any human creation or process can be included.
Purposes for your writing this paper:

- Discover principles from the Word of God related to your use of technology. [Romans 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A2&version=KJV) instructs us to be transformed by renewing our minds. [Psalm 119:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+119%3A9&version=KJV) says we change by listening and obeying to the Word of God.
- Develop thought processes. As we discover the biblical principles that we need to apply, we develop thought processes
that change our actions.
- Decide. As we develop our thinking, we are faced with choices of obedience. Choices made today affect tomorrow. We are becoming today what we will be in the future. "My sheep hear my
voice, and I know them, and they follow me" (John 10:27).

The Bible has much to say about practical living and the Christian life. For this paper we are focusing
solely on Proverbs. We will limit our study of Proverbs for this class to these 5 topics:

1. Communication
1. Friendships
1. Finances
1. Diligence
1. Integrity

## Steps

1. Read Proverbs

    Over the course of working on this paper you should plan to read Proverbs at least twice. Try reading in multiple versions to get a better understanding of the passages. As you are reading, note verses that match the provided topics.

1. Make Tables

    For each topic, choose 10 of the provided subtopics. At least 2 subtopics should be positive and at least 2 should be negative. (See below for the subtopics available for communication.  Subtopics for the other 4 main topics are listed on the schedule.)  For each subtopic, find 2 verses in Proverbs that apply to that subtopic.
    
    Create a nicely-formatted, single-spaced table with 1) whether the subtopic is positive or negative 2) the subtopic, 3) a Proverbs chapter, verse, and text of the verse, 4) an example of that subtopic in technology. 
    
    Unless you are an ESL student, you should quote from a literal translation: KJV, NKJV, ESV, or NASB. Any another translation, including one used by an ESL student, must be approved by the teacher prior to its usage. Your example of technology should be concise—just a sentence fragment. Here is an example table for the Communications topic:

    | Type | Subtopic | Verse | Example |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | | | |

1. Listen and Think

    Begin to formulate your philosophy as you encounter the topics inside and outside of class. Listen in church and chapel. Listen to your friends’ conversations. Pay attention to the news.

1. Write

    After the table of verses for each topic, write a personal practical application of the verses. This double-spaced paragraph is to be written in singular, first person and should be no longer than half a page. Refer to any verses or technology from your table as is appropriate.

## Grammar

Your paper should have correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar. If you wish, you may submit each section to the writing center of the Academic Resource Center for review. They can help you with your grammatical structure as well as with content, if you provide them with the instructions for this paper.

Here are tips to prevent common errors:

- Correct any errors highlighted by Word.
- Use commas between clauses joined by conjunctions and for clarity.
- When you quote a verse, close the quotation mark without final punctuation (unless it is a question mark or exclamation point), give the reference in parentheses, and then put the final period. For example, ". . . the winged creature will make the matter known" (Ecc. 10:20).
- Double spacing after a period is obsolete.
- Ellipses denote omitted content and have spaces between each period: ...
- God, Bible, nouns and pronouns referring to God, Word (in reference to the Bible), and Proverbs (in reference to the book of Proverbs) are capitalized.
- The terms godly and biblically are not capitalized.
