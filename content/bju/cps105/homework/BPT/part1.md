# Biblical Philosophy of Technology Paper

> There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.”
> Proverbs 19:21

## Overview

As Christians we cannot compartmentalize our lives. Knowing Christ affects every area of our lives, including the way we use technology. Very few areas of our lives are unaffected by the technology that surrounds us. When we talk about technology for the purpose of this paper, we are not limited in scope
to computers. Any human creation or process can be included.
Purposes for your writing this paper:

- Discover principles from the Word of God related to your use of technology. [Romans 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A2&version=KJV) instructs us to be transformed by renewing our minds. [Psalm 119:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+119%3A9&version=KJV) says we change by listening and obeying to the Word of God.
- Develop thought processes. As we discover the biblical principles that we need to apply, we develop thought processes
that change our actions.
- Decide. As we develop our thinking, we are faced with choices of obedience. Choices made today affect tomorrow. We are becoming today what we will be in the future. "My sheep hear my
voice, and I know them, and they follow me" (John 10:27).

The Bible has much to say about practical living and the Christian life. For this paper we are focusing
solely on Proverbs. We will limit our study of Proverbs for this class to these 5 topics:

1. Communication
1. Friendships
1. Finances
1. Diligence
1. Integrity

## Steps

1. Read Proverbs

    Over the course of working on this paper you should plan to read Proverbs at least twice. Try reading in multiple versions to get a better understanding of the passages. As you are reading, note verses that match the provided topics.

1. Make Tables

    For each topic, choose 10 of the provided subtopics. At least 2 subtopics should be positive and at least 2 should be negative. (See below for the subtopics available for communication.  Subtopics for the other 4 main topics are listed on the schedule.)  For each subtopic, find 2 verses in Proverbs that apply to that subtopic.
    
    Create a nicely-formatted, single-spaced table with 1) whether the subtopic is positive or negative 2) the subtopic, 3) a Proverbs chapter, verse, and text of the verse, 4) an unique example of that subtopic in technology. 
    
    Unless you are an ESL student, you should quote from a literal translation: KJV, NKJV, ESV, or NASB. Any another translation, including one used by an ESL student, must be approved by the teacher prior to its usage. Your example of technology should be concise—just a sentence fragment. Here is an example table for the Communications topic:

    _Example Table_

    | Type | Subtopic | Verse | Example |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | P | Listening | A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion. (Proverbs 18:2) | Social media not only allows but also encourages us to share our opinions, but rarely do I stop to read the posts of others before I make my own post. |
    | P | Listening | Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise; when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent. (Proverbs 17:28) | When communicating over the phone, I often find myself interrupting others to show that I understand or that I am following.  This is not only rude, but it causes me to seem like I am feigning intelligence on a topic. |
    | P | Concealing Secrets | Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered. (Proverbs 11:3) | I have heard multiple stories of those who have confided secrets in others only to later find those secrets were shared on social media. |
    | P | Concealing Secrets | Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps himself out of trouble. (Proverbs 21:23) | Concealing confidential information not only protects our friendships but it can also keep us from experiencing strife or discipline. |
    | P | Counsel | Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed. (Proverbs 15:22) | Texting and telecommunication have enabled me to easily ask those I consider to be mentors advice; even if I am hundreds of miles away, they can offer Godly encouragement and advice quickly. |
    | P | Counsel | The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice. (Proverbs 12:15) | Many people ask for advice on social media, but this is usually just for show.  The advice given is rarely followed unless it agrees with the requester's preconceptions. |
    | P | Quietness | Better is a dry morsel with quiet than a house full of feasting with strife. (Proverbs 17:1) | The sheer amount of strife on social media is staggering and the arguments can easily provoke us to anger. |
    | P | Quietness | When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but whoever restrains his lips is prudent. (Proverbs 10:19) | Online arguments can easily devolve into name calling slug fests that have no redeeming value due to the screen providing an acceptable shield. |
    | P | Encouragement | Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another. (Proverbs 27:17) | Social media is an excellent platform for sharing prayer needs as well as what God has been teaching me; I must however make sure my heart is in the right place and that I am seeking to elevate Christ and not make myself seem spiritual. |
    | P | Encouragement | Anxiety in a man's heart weighs him down, but a good word makes him glad. (Proverbs 12:25) | Texting friends who are hurting an encouraging message, or that I am praying for them, not only lifts their spirit, it allows me to show concern even when I cannot be physically present with them. |
    | N | Lying | Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, but those who act faithfully are his delight. (Proverbs 12:22) | Lying on social media or via texting to make myself seem more intelligent or "cool" is a sin. |
    | N | Lying | A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who breathes out lies will perish. (Proverbs 19:9) | Often, lies on social media can be easily discovered, embarassing the poster in the process. |
    | N | Slander | Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with a simple babbler. (Proverbs 20:19) | The shield of a screen, or the anonymity of the internet, means that it is all to easy for us to critize others to inflate our own ego. |
    | N | Slander | With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor, but by knowledge the righteous are delivered. (Proverbs 11:9) | Social media is, unfortunately, an excellent platform for bullying, destroying the lives of others simply to sooth your own insecurity. |
    | N | Harsh Words | A fool gives full vent to his spirit, but a wise man quietly holds it back. (Proverbs 29:11) | Social media provides an immediate outlet for expressing frustration with another individual, hurting relationships in the process. |
    | N | Harsh Words | There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. (Proverbs 12:18) | Texting friends that I am angry with immediately leads to strife and a lessened bond rather than if I wait, pray and respond in love. |
    | N | Hasty Words | Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him. (Proverbs 29:20) | Message boards invite quick, thoughtless, responses that can easily offend others. |
    | N | Hasty Words | A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion. (Proverbs 18:2) | Posting about topics that I am not familiar with instead of listening to others causes me to seem not only foolish but rude. |
    | N | Boasting | Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring. (Proverbs 27:1) | Social media allows us to boast of our accomplishments so that all may see them, with us often receiving the glory instead of Christ. |
    | N | Boasting | Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of a gift he does not give. (Proverbs 25:14) | Social media makes it easy to say that we have given to the poor, but in reality we have kept the money for ourself. |

    _Example Summary Paragraph_

    Technology is an excellent facilitator of communication, after all, that is what the Internet and the social media platforms which sit on top of the Internet were designed for.  However, with the advent of easier communication, the principles I find in Proverbs are all the more applicable. I find that the rapid speed of communication on the Internet causes me to be less discerning in my real world speech.  Proverbs 17:28 says that even a fool appears intelligent if he remains silent, but the instantaneous back and forth communication of social media and texting have led me to sometimes carry on real-life conversations in the same manner, interrupting the person I am talking to.  This is not only demeaning to the individual I am conversing with but it is also a way to puff myself up by showing that I am quick to understand where they are going with their words.  I also find that wicked habits I developed on message boards during my teenage years have filtered into my every day conversations.  Out of habit, I often lie to make myself seem more “acceptable” to others.  Proverbs 12:22 and 19:9 are sobering reminders of what God thinks of this habit and how badly I need His grace to overcome it.  However, communication via technological means is not all bad.  Technology has enabled me many times to encourage or grieve with friends who are thousands of miles away. As Proverbs 12:25 reminds me, good words lighten the heart, but they also deepen friendships. Ultimately, whatever communication I use must honor Christ and be rooted in Godly wisdom. The communication principles I find in Proverbs can help me keep my conversations wise and Godly no matter the medium.

1. Listen and Think

    Begin to formulate your philosophy as you encounter the topics inside and outside of class. Listen in church and chapel. Listen to your friends’ conversations. Pay attention to the news.

1. Write

    After the table of verses for each topic, write a personal practical application of the verses. This double-spaced paragraph is to be written in singular, first person and should be no longer than half a page. Refer to any verses or technology from your table as is appropriate.

## Grammar

Your paper should have correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar. If you wish, you may submit each section to the writing center of the Academic Resource Center for review. They can help you with your grammatical structure as well as with content, if you provide them with the instructions for this paper.

Here are tips to prevent common errors:

- Correct any errors highlighted by Word.
- Use commas between clauses joined by conjunctions and for clarity.
- When you quote a verse, close the quotation mark without final punctuation (unless it is a question mark or exclamation point), give the reference in parentheses, and then put the final period. For example, ". . . the winged creature will make the matter known" (Ecc. 10:20).
- Double spacing after a period is obsolete.
- Ellipses denote omitted content and have spaces between each period: ...
- God, Bible, nouns and pronouns referring to God, Word (in reference to the Bible), and Proverbs (in reference to the book of Proverbs) are capitalized.
- The terms godly and biblically are not capitalized.
