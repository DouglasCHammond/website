Keep [1 Cor. 5:9-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=I+Corinthians+5%3A9-13&version=KJV), [Gal. 6:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A1&version=KJV), and [2 Cor. 6:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=II+Corinthians+6%3A14&version=KJV) in mind to help you differentiate between outreach and partnership.
