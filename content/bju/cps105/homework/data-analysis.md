1. Save the file you selected in Excel as an “Excel Workbook (*.xlsx).”
1. Create three (3) frequency tables, each based on one variable (column) from your data set.

    - One of the frequency tables is to be on qualitative (non-numeric) data.
    - Two of the frequency tables are to be on quantitative (numerical) data. Follow the 2K rule (The number of classes is k, where 2k > the number of data points. The interval between classes should be at least (highest value-lowest value)/k). 
    - For each frequency table, create either a bar chart or a pie chart. 
    - You must have at least one bar chart and one pie chart. If necessary, you may create a fourth frequency table to provide data better suited to a pie chart.

1. Create two (2) pivot tables across two different sets of variables for your data set. One of them should sum the values, and one should average them.
