        <h1>Endangered Butterflies</h1>
        <h1>Nabokov's <span class="b">Blues</span> Threatened</h1>
        <p>
            Vladimir Nobokov, the famous author or <i>Lolita</i> was also a lepidopterist.
            He studied and named butterflies known as <b style="color: blue">Blues</b>. He was
            interested in butterflies both scientifically and literalily.  In his novel <i>Pnin</i>
            Nobokov wrote "A score of small butterflies, all of one kind, were settled on a damp patch
            of sand, their wing erect and closed, showing their pale undersides with dark dots and tiny
            orange-rimmed peacock spots along their hind-wing margins; one of Pnin's shed rubbers disturbed
            some of them and revealing the celestial hue of their upper surface, they fluttered around
            like blue snowflakes before settling again."  This butterfly, Karner's Blue, named by Nobokov, is
            among several thousand threatened by extinction.
