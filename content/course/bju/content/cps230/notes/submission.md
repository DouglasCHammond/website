title: Submitting Code
layout: page

Unless otherwise stated by an assignment's instructions, you should assume you will be submitting code (and any related files)
via the Git-based SRS (submission/review system). 

How to use SRS is laid out in ample detail [here]({{site.baseurl}}/srs).

Be aware that there may or may not be a Jenkins build/test job for each assignment using SRS; in that case,
you will simply submit your code using the Git half of SRS and hope for the best w.r.t. to building and running. :-)
