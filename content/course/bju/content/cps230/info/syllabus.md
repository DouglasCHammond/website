## Description
Assembly language, interrupts, registers, memory addressing techniques, parameter passing mechanisms and the relationship between high-level languages and the computer. Both semesters, three credits. _Prerequisite: CpS 110_.

## Context
This course addresses the following learning outcomes of the computer science major:

* CS1 - Design and implement efficient solutions to problems in various domains.
* CS2 - Demonstrate understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science; including:
	* language translation
	* limitations of computers
	* von Neumann architecture
	* memory hierarchy
	* quality data representation

This course further addresses the following learning outcomes of the engineering major:

* 1.3.12 - Write programs.
* 1.4.1 - Apply additional depth of knowledge in engineering topics of interest to the student.

## Goals
This course will provide:

* Understanding of computer systems architecture
* Understanding of data representation in a computer
* Understanding of the x86 and IBM-PC architecture
* Skill in programming x86 processors at the assembly level
* Appreciation for the importance of assembly language

## Assignments
**In-Class Quizzes**: taken and graded in class; closed-book/notes unless otherwise announced. The lowest quiz grade is automatically dropped.

**Tests**: taken in class; closed-book/notes unless otherwise announced.

**Homework**: take-home written exercises that reinforce key non-programming concepts and skills.

**Labs**: small-scale individual programming assignments that introduce ideas that you will apply on a larger scale in the programming assignments.

**Programs**: larger-scale individual programming assignments that require original thinking to solve a nontrivial problem using newly-acquired concepts and skills.

**Team Project**: a large scale team programming assignment that requires both mastery of the course material and extensive teamwork and communication skills.

## Grading

Grade reports will be available via BJUOnline. The following is a tentative breakdown of how the final grade is calculated. (Note that exact point totals may be subject to change.)
  
| # | Item | Points | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11 | In-class Quizzes (lowest grade dropped) | 10 | 100 |
| 4 | Take-home homework worksheets/exercises | 20-40 | 100 |
| 10 | Lab exercises (programming) | 10-25 | 150 |
| 2 | Programs | 50 | 100 |
| 1 | Team Project | 250 | 250 |
| 3 | Tests | 100 | 300 |
| | Total Points | | 1010 |

Final grades will be computed on a 10% scale with rounding:

| Lowest Grade | Highest Grade | Letter Grade |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 89.5 | 100 | A |
| 79.5 | 89.49 | B |
| 69.5 | 79.49 | C |
| 59.5 | 69.49 | D |
| 0 | 59.49 | F |

## Deadlines and Late Work
Unless otherwise specified by the instructor, assignments can receive full credit only if **submitted in full by midnight of the due date**. A 25% penalty will be applied if the assignment is not turned in on time and a free late is not used. No credit is possible after one week. If you anticipate trouble on an assignment, see the instructor as soon as possible for assistance.

Students receive **1** free late which can be used, at their discretion.  This allows a student to turn the assignment in, up to one week late, with no penalty applied.  After one week, no credit is possible. **The free late may not be used on Lab 11. For the final project, the extension is 3 days rather than 1 week and all team members must have a free late available.**

There will be no makeup quizzes except for University authorized absences for which the student made prior arrangements with the instructor. Students who are not present for a quiz will receive a 0. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.

## Attendance
The University’s mission includes instilling responsibility, dependability and punctuality in students. Training students in these virtues is accomplished in part through holding students accountable for their class attendance. The Class Attendance Policy makes clear to students expectations in regard to class attendance and the consequences of failure to fulfill these academic responsibilities. This policy also gives direction to the administration and faculty in formulating and implementing a reasonable structure for such accountability.

The University recognizes that there are valuable learning experiences outside of the classroom that may require a student to miss regularly scheduled classes. Therefore this policy makes provision for Service Absences.

### Personal Absences
Based on the number of times that a course meets each week during a semester, students are permitted a defined number of Personal Absences. The chart below defines the number of permitted Personal Absences.

Students apply Personal Absences for funerals, for sickness, for doctor’s or dentist’s appointments, for visits and interviews at graduate schools or for interviews for future employment. Personal Absences are not “skips.” Personal Absences are not provided so that students can prepare for other classes or extend official university breaks or simply because they do not feel well. Students should use Personal Absences only for genuine emergencies or contagious or debilitating illness. In order to conserve Personal Absences, students should work with doctor’s or dentist’s offices to intentionally schedule appointments during times when they do not have classes or chapel.

| Class Meeings Per Week | Personal Absences Allowed |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 4 |
| 5 | 5 |
| Block | 0 |

Students who are withdrawn from courses due to excess class absences may lose student financial aid; also, in such circumstances, the visa status of international students may be jeopardized.

### Service Absences
Based on the number of times that a course meets each week during a semester, students are also permitted a defined number of Service Absences. Students may use these absences to attend approved academic functions or conferences, approved Christian service projects, required military duty or as part of an intercollegiate athletic team. However, students who exceed the Personal Absence limit due to a chronic illness are not eligible to participate in events that require Services Absences. Also, students who are on any type of academic restriction (including probation) or who have a current grade report with a cumulative GPA below 2.0 are not eligible to participate in events that require Service Absences. The chart below defines the number of permitted Service Absences.

| Class Meeings Per Week | Personal Absences Allowed |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 4 |
| 4 | 5 |
| 5 | 7 |
| Block | 0 |

Students should understand that they may not have enough Service Absences to participate in all the events that are offered in the courses and activities in which they are participating in a particular semester. Such a circumstance offers students the opportunity to learn that life at times will force them to make a choice between more than one desirable options. In such a situation, students are not permitted to exceed the number of permitted Service Absences for the course and so they must choose which service events they wish to participate in.

Students who participate in an event requiring a Service Absence are required to contact their instructors at least one week in advance of the absence to make up work that will be missed. Such students will be allowed to take any quiz or test either in advance of the absence or while traveling (with proper supervision by the faculty sponsor/coach). Such students are responsible to schedule presentations or speeches on days that they know they will not be traveling. Whether to allow students participating in these events to submit work after the due date without penalty is left to the instructor's discretion.

### Partial Attendance
Students who arrive up to 15 minutes after the start of class, or who leave class up to 15 minutes early, will receive a mark for Partial Attendance. Three Partial Attendance marks will count as a Personal Absence. Students who miss more than 15 minutes of a class period will be counted as absent.

### Tracking Absences
Students can view absences and the number of Partial Attendance marks that they have for a course in StudentCentral. StudentCentral also automatically sends emails to students to inform them when faculty have marked them absent or late for a class and to warn them when they have exhausted their Personal Absences, Service Absences or both. It is the responsibility of all students to monitor the record of their class attendance available in StudentCentral and to read the automated emails that inform them when instructors have marked them absent or late.

### Chronic Illness
Students who have a chronic illness (e.g., diabetes, asthma, migraines, etc.) and are absent from classes because of prolonged or recurring symptoms:

* are to secure a doctor’s note stating that they have a chronic illness;
* are to present the note to the Student Services Hub in advance or within two business days of returning to classes after an illness-related absence;
* are to inform instructors in their courses that they have a chronic condition

For future absences because of the same chronic illness, the student is to email the Student Services Hub (hub@bju.edu) the following information within 24 hours of a missed class:

* Name and ID #
* A statement indicating that the reason for the absence is a chronic condition with a doctor’s note already on file
* Date and class(es) missed

Students with a chronic illness are to keep their class absences to a minimum. Students with chronic illnesses may use the total of both Personal Absences and Service Absences. However, students who exceed the Personal Absence limit due to a chronic illness are not eligible for participation in events that require Services Absences. Students who exceed the total of both Personal Absences and Service Absences will be withdrawn from course(s) and/or the University.

Doctor's notes for chronic illness are valid for the current academic year. For continuing illness, a new note is required each academic year.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you have a documented learning disability or if you are impaired in some way (auditory, visual, cognitive, neurological, or physical), please let your instructor know this within the first week of the course so that any necessary adjustments can be made before you get behind. See the guidelines on accommodations eligibility available from Academic Resource Center for details.

## Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy
Cheating on assignments and tests is forbidden. All work is to be done individually unless group work is explicitly permitted. No collaboration is allowed on tests. For regular individual assignments, we expect that the submitted work represents the student’s own intellectual effort, defined as follows:

1. The program was written primarily by the student. This means that most of the code (aside from starting code provided by the instructor) must have been crafted, not copied, by the student.
2. External resources used, whether electronic or from another human, must be documented as follows:
	* Code snippets copied from online resources must be documented by a comment just above the copied snippet giving the URL of the page containing the source.
	* Explanatory help or advice regarding the design or implementation of the solution received from people other than the instructor must be documented in a report accompanying the assignment submission. This report must detail:
		* Source of information (e.g., name/email of the person who helped)
		* Relevance (i.e., how this resource helped and/or what it provided)
	* Note that students must not consult a solution to the assignment as a resource in crafting their own solution, nor share their own solution with another student. Doing so constitutes cheating.
3. The student must be able to explain, on demand, the entirety of the program on both the syntactic and semantic level.

Not all kinds of programming assignments require the same demonstration of personal intellectual effort. In the absence of any specific instructions, students should assume that at a minimum:

* For individual lab assignments, requirements 1 and 3 apply.
* For individual programming assignments, all three requirements apply.
* For group programming projects, only requirement 3 applies.

Failure to comply with any relevant integrity requirement constitutes cheating. Such incidents will be reported to the academic integrity committee. To avoid trouble:

* Do not look at another student's program code when seeking assistance. On the other hand, if another student is seeking help from you, never use your own program code as an example. The only acceptable reason another student may look at your code is to help you find a problem in your program.
* Do not write program code while another student (or lab assistant) is sitting with you. You may work out designs in pseudocode on paper with another student, but you must write program code by yourself.
* When seeking assistance from another person on a program assignment, always get his/her name so you can fulfill the documentation requirements.
