# Bitbucket Introduction
## Setup

You'll receive an email invitation to Bitbucket.  Use the link to create an account, if you don't have one, or if you do have one, sign in with your account to associate the repository with your account.  _Pro tip: If you associate your .edu email with the Bitbucket account, you get unlimited private repositories for as long as your .edu email remains active._

## Tool Installation

If you are already familiar with Git, feel free to use whatever tools you already know.  My personal recommendation is that you use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) which has both OS X and Windows clients.

When finishing installation, sign in with your already existing Bitbucket account (which doubles as an Atlassian account).

When asked to add an account, click Bitbucket, then continue.  You'll have to sign in to Bitbucket one more time.

After setup is complete, and you see the window below, click remote.  Then click clone beside the submission repository (your bju username).

## Submitting your Assignment

Git tracks any changes made to the repository (folder), and you are welcome to use your repository for version control as well as submissions.  I will grade whatever is in the folder at midnight on the due date.

To submit your assignment, copy it into the appropriate folder, then open sourcetree.  Click on the submissions repository.

First, click pull.  This will download any new submission folders that are available.  Second, click commit.

Notice, how all changed files are listed, and if you click a file, you can see what has changed.  Drag all the files you wish to submit to the staged files area.  Then enter a message detailing what you changed in the box at the bottom.  Finally click commit.

Once you are finished commiting, click Push.  This will upload your changes to Bitbucket so that I can see them.

To make sure that everything uploaded correctly, go to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) and login.  View your repository in the online browser to make sure your changes made it.
