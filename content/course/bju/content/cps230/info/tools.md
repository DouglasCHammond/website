## Needed right away

* Microsoft Windows
    - Preferably Windows 10
    - If you don't wish to install it natively, you can run it in a VM
    - Available to you free of charge via MSDNAA (see the CS lab monitors for details)

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
    - The free [community edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) is fine
    - Or you can get the professional/enterprise versions, also for free, via MSDNAA (see the CS lab monitors for details)
    - Make sure you install the C++ tools and project templates (which are not enabled by default)
    - [VS 2017 Build Tools](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017)

## Needed Before Too Long

* NASM (the Netwide Assembler)
    - v2.12.02 (or later)
    - If the installer asks, you *don't* need either "RDOFF" support or "VS8 Integration"

* DOSBox (with the integrated debugger)
    - *The normal DOSBox installer typically doesn't give you this!*
    - You can build DOSBox from source to get the debugger [have fun!]
    - Or you can download this [ZIP file](/course/bju/content/cps230/downloads/dbd.zip)
    - Either way, I will assume you installed the executable at `C:\cps230\bin\dbd.exe` (you're free to put it somewhere else, just remember to translate the instructions appropriately)
