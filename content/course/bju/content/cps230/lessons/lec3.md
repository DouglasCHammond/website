# Lecture 3: Words (and Words)

## Bits, Bytes and Words

Computers have to work with fixed-size binary numbers.  This helps us know where things start and where things end, and otherwise prevents chaos.  

Bits obviously are the smallest fixed-size, just 1.  The smallest addressable size is a byte (which is 8 bits).  Words (or "native sizes") are the size of an address for an architecture, and the choice of word size for an architecture is important.  It is typically the amount of data that a processor can handle in one go.
