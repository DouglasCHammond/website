# Lecture 17: Linking Example 2

We once again have two files creatively named `jackal.asm` and `hen.asm`.  The definitions of both files as well as the symbol table, relocation tables and binary for both are below.

## jackal.asm
```asm
extern _screw_driver
extern _hammer

section .text
    int3
    int3
    int3
    int3
    int3

global _wrench
_wrench:
    push    ebp
    mov     ebp, esp

    push    dword [clown_car]
    call    _screw_driver
    add     esp, 4

    pop     ebp
    ret

section .data
    db 0,0
clown_car  dd  0x15e
    db 0,0
global pogo_stick
pogo_stick  dd  0x307
```

## hen.asm
```asm
extern _wrench
extern pogo_stick

section .text
    int3
    int3
    int3
    int3
    int3

global _screw_driver
_screw_driver:
    mov eax, [lemon]
    xor eax, [pogo_stick]
    ret

    int3
    int3

global _hammer
_hammer:
    mov eax, [pogo_stick]
    add eax, [kumquat]
    ret


section .data
kumquat  dd  0x320
lemon  dd  _wrench
```

# Linking & Section Summary Table

Now that we have all of that information, we need to concatenate the files together in the right order.  Remember `.text` sections first and `.data` sections after (in the order the files are given).  Also remember that some parts are done by the operating system when the program is loaded into memory.  Those are helpfully marked with an asterisk and we'll need a memory address, `0x2a99000`, to calculate them.

| Section | Offset | Address* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jackal.text | 0 | 0x2a99000 |
| hen.text | 32 | 0x2a99020 |
| jackal.data | 64 | 0x2a99040 | 
| hen.data | 80 | 0x2a99050 | 

Finally, the combined file, with padding is:

```
00: CC CC CC CC CC 55 89 E5  FF 35 02 00 00 00 E8 00  .....U...5......
10: 00 00 00 83 C4 04 5D C3  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ......].........
20: CC CC CC CC CC A1 04 00  00 00 33 05 00 00 00 00  ..........3.....
30: C3 CC CC A1 00 00 00 00  03 05 00 00 00 00 C3 00  ................
40: 00 00 5E 01 00 00 00 00  07 03 00 00 00 00 00 00  ..^.............
50: 20 03 00 00 00 00 00 00                            .......
```

# Symbol Summary Table

We now generate the symbol summary table which combines the individual files symbol summaries (excluding extern symbols). Remember that the offset is directly copied from the individual file's symbol table record.  Then when calculating the address, we use add the offset to the section's address.

| Symbol | Offset | From | Memory Address* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \_wrench | 5 | jackal.text | 0x2a99005 |
| \_screw\_driver | 5 | hen.text | 0x2a99025 |
| \_hammer | 19 | hen.text | 0x2a99033 |
| pogo\_stick | 8 | jackal.data | 0x2a99048  |

# Relocation Summary Table

Finally, we do the last and final table.  We take all 4 relocation tables (for each of our four sections) and smash them together adding a bit of information. The site is generated the same way as the memory address column of the symbol summary table (offset + section address).  The adjusted value column is the only oddity as its calculation varies depending on direct or relative.  For direct use the calculation `target address` + `value`.  For relative use the calculation `target address` - (`site address` + 4) + 1.

| Section | Offset | Site* | Kind | Target Symbol | Value | Adjusted Value* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| jackal.text | 10 | 0x2a9900A | DIR32 | jackal.data | 0x2 | 0x2a99042 |
| jackal.text | 15 | 0x2a9900F | REL32 | \_screw\_driver | 0x0 | 0x13 |
| hen.text | 6 | 0x2a99026 | DIR32 | hen.data | 0x4 | 0x2a99054 |
| hen.text | 12 | 0x2a9902C | DIR32 | pogo_stick | 0x0 | 0x2a99048 |
| hen.text | 20 | 0x2a99034 | DIR32 | pogo_stick | 0x0 | 0x2a99048 |
| hen.text | 26 | 0x2a9903A | DIR32 | hen.data | 0x0 | 0x2a99050 |
| hen.data | 4 | 0x2a99044 | DIR32 | \_wrench | 0x0 | 0x2a99005 |

Now all that is left is pluggin the adjusted value into the correct address (or the offset).
