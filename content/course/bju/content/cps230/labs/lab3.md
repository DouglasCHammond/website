# Lab 3
## Overview

For this lab you will write C code to solve several bit-manipulation puzzles from your textbook.  Namely:

* 2.64: `any_odd_one`
* 2.66: `leftmost_one`
* 2.68: `lower_one_mask`

## Procedure

Use the [starting code](/course/bju/content/cps230/downloads/lab3.c).  Your job is to

* Fill out the function bodies (i.e., replace the `/* TODO */` comments)
* Add a few more tests for each function implemented (see the existing comments in the code for more)

**Be sure to follow the rules specified on p. 120!**  Among other things, these rules *prohibit loops* (since you don't need them).

## Hints

* 2.66 is the hardest of the 3; save it for last

## Report

Follow the standard template, and make sure you explain how you solved each puzzle (i.e., your thought process, not your code).

If you are not printing a physical copy, make sure to list in the report any help you received as well as a statement that all work is your own.  Help received from the professor does not need to be listed. The electronic report should be submitted along with your code.

If you are printing out your report, staple one of the department honesty sheets to the top listing the help received on the sheet.  Turn this printed report in at the beginning of the class period after the due date.

## Submission

Submit `report.docx/pdf` and your completed `lab3.c`.

## Grading

This lab is worth **15 points** total:

* 9 points for a well-formed submission (including report)
* 2 points for each problem solved
