## Overview

Here you give a **succinct** (2-5 sentence) synopsis of the lab instructions and learning objectives.
Bullet points are helpful, but they should not be the only thing in here.

## Obstacles

Document (in bullet-list format) any unexpected technical (or other) difficulties you encountered during the lab,
along with how you overcame them.  Be sure to credit people who helped you; it's only fair!

If appropriate, include screenshots in your report.

## Results

Begin by stating whether you completed the lab or not (and if not, what was left undone).

Follow up with a separate paragraph summarizing what new things *you* learned from the lab.
Take a minute to think about this before writing; your list may (and often will) look different from the stated learning objectives.
