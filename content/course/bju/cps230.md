## Announcements

* A [Mid-Term Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/mXQfmaDykA713iDk2) is available for you to complete if you would like.  It is not required, but comments for how you believe the course could be improved would be appreciated. Mid-Term surveys allow me to take your feedback into account earlier potentially helping your current classmates rather than having than helping future classes.
